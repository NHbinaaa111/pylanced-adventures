# pylanced-adventures
This is a beginner project of my start for programming. 
I have been working on this for 3 weeks and it's pretty polished!

Pylanced-adventures is an adventure platformer based on area 51 theme in which you have to dogde aliens and make your way up to the exit. You can also edit the levels after you have completed all of them.
